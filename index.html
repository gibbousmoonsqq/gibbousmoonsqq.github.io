    <p>Congratulations! You are now a contestant on the popular television game show "Slut Life." For the next year, you will be living in an apartment provided by us together with the other contestants. All your actions will be monitored and broadcasted constantly to a universal audience. At the end of the year, you can choose from a list of rewards. Breaking any rules will result in the instant revocation of your reward.</p> 
    <p>As part of the show, you will be transported to another planet for the duration of your stay. Instead of the normal 24 hour days you're used to, each day on this planet lasts for 32 hours. While this may seem tiring at first, your body will adjust rather quickly. After you're done, you can either stay here or go back to Earth.</p>
    <p>To begin, first select a difficulty from the section immediately below.  This will determine your starting number of points, tracked on the top of this page.  Taking options later in will add or subtract from this point total.  You must have greater than or equal to zero points at the end of this CYOA, and while you do not <i>have</i> to obey the restrictions in the options' descriptions it's a bit cheating not to.  Good luck!</p>

        As part of the show, you will be given a completely new body for +40 credits. Alternatively, you can elect to keep your current body for +20 credits; ignore the rest of this section if you choose to do so.  If you do choose to create a new body, you will need to freely decide whether you start with:<br>
        -Your age, from 10-80 years old.<br>
        -Your height, from 2'5"-10'.<br>
        -Your face, choosing from handsome, manly, boyish, androgynous, girly, womanly, beautiful, and bimbo.<br>
        -Your chest, choosing from flat up to greater than f-cup.<br>
        -Your ass, choosing from flat, petite, normal, apple bubble, badonk, wide, and double wide.<br>
        -A starting genetalia, choosing from a penis, a nonfertile vagina, a fertile vagina, or no sex.  <br>
        -If you have a penis, its size from 1"-16".<br>
        -If you have a penis, its girth from 0.25"-3".<br>
        -If you have a penis, their size from half to twice that of your penis girth.<br>
        -Your hair length, between 0" and 4'.<br>
        -Your natural hair color, including all naturally and unnaturally occuring hair colors.<br>
        -Your eye color, including all naturally and unnaturally occuring eye colors.<br>
        -Your skin color, including all naturally and unnaturally occuring skin colors.<br>
        -Your body type, choosing from skinny, athletic, average, and chubby.<br>
        -And your voice, choosing from masculine, feminine, childish, and mute.  <br>
        <br>
        If your starting age is 10 - 17, you will start at a "reduced" version and "grow into" what you chose.  Hyperfertile vaginas have a 100% pregnancy rate among the same species parents, a 20% chance of being impregnated by a father of a different species (half-human species are considered the same species genetically), and do not respond to chemical contraceptives. Each penis has its own set of testicles, however they can be removed if you don't want them. Embedded testicles overrides testicle size. Girth refers to diameter, in this case. Genitals determine sex: male is penis only, female is vagina only, futanari/hermaphrodite is both vagina and penis. If you look/act female but have a penis, you are considered a trap and can override non-male-only restrictions.<br>
